Haste is an accelerated ray tracer. Right now it uses GPUs to accerate
tracing (specifically NVIDIA GPUs by using CUDA), but in the future it
might use something else, like laser beams. Who knows?

It started as a class project for CPE 520 (Graduate Computer Architecture)
at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CA by Bob Somers and Chris Gibson. It is
now being expanded and used in their Masters Thesis work.

It is licensed under a modified MIT license. Don't worry, the modifications
are minimal. See the LICENSE file for details.

Until our thesis work is complete (June 2011) the code is open source,
but we are not taking outside contributions to the project. After that,
we may start taking community input at our discretion. It depends.
